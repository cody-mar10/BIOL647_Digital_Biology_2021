+ *Brief Discussion about Bootstrapping*
  + Definition: Computing a technique of loading a program into a
    computer by means of a few initial instructions which enable the
    introduction of the rest of the program from an input device.
  + Bootstrapping in Biology
    + Typical examples of bootstrapping in Biology include but are not restricted to /translation/
      + To produce a /Protein/, you need:
        : mRNA + Ribosomes + tRNAs + AminoAcids
        : mRNA = DNA + RNA Polymerase II (Protein)
        : Ribosomes = RNA + Proteins
        : RNA = DNA + RNA Polymerase I (Protein)
        : Proteins = mRNA + Ribosomes + tRNAs + AminoAcids
  + Bootstrapping in Digital Biology
# + *SSHing Without Activating X11*
